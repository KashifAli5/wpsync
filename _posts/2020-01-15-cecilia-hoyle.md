Simi is a proud TEXAN who lives in Round Rock/Austin area with her family for over 20 years. As you all know and do agree that everything is bigger in Texas, so are the people’s hearts. Simi fell in love with Austin & decided to call this her home forever. She was born and raised and lived in Pakistan through her teen years. Simi is very familiar with Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian customs, expectations and cultures. She understands that relocating to a new place can be challenging and she wants them to feel they are not alone in this process. When you find a right Realtor, this process can be fun and hassle free because your realtor should be able to take your stress away!

In Simi’s spare time, you can find her walking by the ocean, hiking in the mountains or just being in nature and playing with her pets. She loves to cuddle up with a good book or anything that is worth reading. Simi believes in “paying it forward” and making a difference by doing random acts of kindness.
